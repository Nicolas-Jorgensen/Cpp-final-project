A dungeon room 'maker' using a multi-linked list.
Entering commands allows you to create, name, connect and traverse rooms. There is also a working save and load feature. The Room class was created by my instructor and we
weren't allowed to edit it. If we were, I would have included a lot of the functions that ended up in main as member functions of the Room class to keep things cleaner.
Sorry for messy formatting.
